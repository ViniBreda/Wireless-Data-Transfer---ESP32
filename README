# Wireless Data Transfer Between two ESP32 - DOIT Devkit 1

* File upload via bluetooth available BUT VERY SLOW;
* The goal is to send a 500KB file from one ESP32 to another, atleast 100m apart;
* The PCB was of the transmission board was designed considering up to eight IÂ²C devices connected to it so it works as a DataLogger;
* The receiver PCB is just a normal DOIT Devkit 1 remake to learn how to use KiCad;
* This is just a concept, not all funcionalities will be developed/tested as the main goal is to send a file over a Wireless Conection, one of them being battery powered.
